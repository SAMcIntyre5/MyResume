										<h2 class="major">Web Programming</h2>
										<h3>BigforkWeb Development</h3>
										<p>How did I end up in web programming?  It all start on June 14, 2003 when I got laid off from Prolific Publishing Inc after working me to death
for over two years.  I tried to get into other gaming company at that time but they all already hired for their present projects.  Months went by and I received the same letters.  With the 
cost of California life, I decided to move to a cheap state and try for any job there.</p>  
										<p>So off to Montana the place I vacation I went.  I applied to any tech jobs included web with no success.  Then I started applying to any job and was able to get them with no problems.  I never gave up and finally got the job at Bigfork Web Development when I did a test for him.
										He gave me a month trial and when he reviewed me he gave me a raise.  He told me that he was surprised that someone with no web programming knowledge was able to do
										all the work he gave me on time with the new languages that I had to program in.  Basically, he realized that my statement on my resume that I learn fast and can do anything was correct.  I worked hard for him and on the next review got
										another raise and praise from him.  I was the backend programmer.  I dealt with asp, php, mysql, sql and of course html.  I did all sorts of web stuff from basic mods to creating pages that pulled from the database.</p>
										<p>I loved it all.  The constant learning new things was a constant joy for me and one I will never forget or regret.</p>
										
										<h3>Contracting</h3>
										<p>Now that life at BigforkWeb was over it was time for me to work for myself.  I started by joining Steve Pittenger who I meet when I was in the physical labor job
										at Anchor Alarms.  He was constantly on the phone making connections to do websites for people.  So when my work dried up at BigforkWeb, I contacted him to let him know if
										he had work that he needed done to contact me.  He did right away.  I started with him on a bizgreet project.  This was a major project and at first it sounded great.
										I gave him an hour estimate to which he wanted to reduce.  I told him to do it correctly that was what was needed.  He told me that the client wanted it down and dirty.</p>
										<p>The site offered a lot and was done in wordpress something new for me.  The database stuff was something I was very farmiliar with and I agreed to do it the way they wanted even though it want against everything I was taught.  I needed the money.</p>
										<p>Since Steve never sent me our agreement, he kept having do more intensive work fixing the problems with down and dirty coding which was against what they paid for.  So I ended up in the end giving them proper coding for down and dirty price.  It wasn't
										fair and a lesson learned.</p>
										<p>The client had another minor project that they wanted done and Steve contacted me about it.  This time I wasn't on the Skype or answer my phone when he called so he had to send me email with the details.
										I was finally doing things correctly.  I did the job and sent it to him.  He proceed to email about wanting better coding and not what he put in his email.  Being smart this time, I sent the initial email with his instruction to him with an add
										that I would be happy to do the coding but it will cost since that wasn't what he agreed to pay for.  He emails back stating no thanks.  I may not have gotten more work from him but he was now paying for what he was getting only.</p>
										<p>The first project cost me over 200 hours of my own time.  Now at least I am getting paid for what I was doing.</p>
										<p>Steve ability to tell me the truth became a big problem so I had to stop working for him.  At the same time, I got tired of Montana job market and want to try another area.  I bought a house cheap and moved to Central Oregon.
										I applied for many jobs in my field with no luck and again tried in the physical job which I got with ease.  The problem with that was I kept getting hurt at those jobs and had to leave.</p>
										<p>I worked as a contract but work was hard to find.  So mainly I continued my education with bootstrap and other web programming tools.</p>
