										<h3>Candyland</h3>
										<p>This demo will test the players spelling, math and timing abilities. You start out with three guesses and lives. Picking up coins adds to your guesses. But use up your guesses or lives and you lose. There are three levels.</p>
										
										<h4>Spelling Level</h4>
										<p>The picture that the block stops on is what you have to spell. You do this by touching the letter you want in the correct order. But touch a wrong letter and you lose a guess. Once you spell out all 6 pictures correctly, the bar will raise and you can move to the next level.</p>
										
										<h4>Timing Level</h4>
										<p>There are three paths across the ocean to the third level. Two are hard involving timing as well as coins for extra guesses. There is one path going across with no coins but has no timing. If you fall into the ocean, you die. The path taken is up to the player.</p>
										
										<h4>Math Level</h4>
										<p>The third level is math problems. A math problem comes out and you must touch the answer numbers from left to right. (Ex. 20 * 5 = 100; First hit 1, then 0 and then another 0) After completing successfully, a trophy will come out and you need to touch it to finish the game.</p>

										<h3>Carnival</h3>
										<p>Background:  The magician at the carnival received a package one day. He opened it revealing a box with strange carvings on it. Even though he didn’t understand what the carvings meant, he opened the box. Spirits/Ghosts flew out of the box and exited his tent. 
										They flew all over taking control of everything from cannons, booth games, rides, etc. People, including the carnival people, ran screaming from the area leaving all to the ghost.</p>
										<p>Your objective is to restore the carnival.</p>
										<p>General Rules: The player collects tickets to enter the next levels at the ticket booths. Hitting 20 balloons adds a live to the player. You start with 3 lives.</p>
										
										<h4>Tents Level</h4>
										<p>The player needs to collect 10 tickets to enter the next level. 
										While searching for the tickets, the player needs to avoid moving objects that cause minor to medium damage. 
										Apples and bunnies give health in this level only.</p>
										
										<h4>Booths Level</h4>
										<p>The player must win the booths that haven’t been taken over. 
										Upon winning, a gold ticket and in most cases a golden bunny or fish will appear. 
										The golden ticket is worth 5 normal tickets and the fish or golden bunny will put the player in god mode for a time period. 
										Also all surrounding booths that are out of control will stop on the win. On the winning of the last booth and collecting its ticket a trophy will appear. 
										The player will need to take the trophy and head to the last ticket booth with at least 65 tickets to enter the ride area.</p>
										
										<h4>Rides Level</h4>
										<p>The player will go through the haunted house first to get to the ride area. 
										All moving objects in the ride area will kill on first contact except balloons. 
										The player must get the trophy to the podium before he/she runs out of lives.</p>
