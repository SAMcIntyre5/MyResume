							  <h3>Dreamers Guild Inc</h3>
							  <p>I worked here from 1994 to 1996 on six games.  This was my first gaming job working on PC over Unix and the Vax programming.  But I did take windows classes while laid off from Hughes Aircraft before applying for the level building position.
							  Since I never did programming in the languages they were working in at the time, I decided to start with level building.  Needless to say, I fell in love
							  with creating the levels and creating new art out of existing art to make what I wanted to create work.  I was highly wanted on all the projects and was pulled into other projects to give my
							  advice to make the game great or to get it on track.  One downside I found was the fact I was never allowed to take a vacation.  I was valued so high that they couldn't have me leave for more then just one day.
							  The ones marked with didn't go to market was at the end before the company went bankrupt.</p>

										<h3>I have No Mouth and I must Scream</h3>
										<p>I start in Jan 1995 on this project and ended on September 1995.  When I first got on this game, the author was wanting to shelve it because the characters would pop from one location into another and start a different animation.
										I agreed with the auther and didn't like the game in it present condition.  So I actually created art from the different files and put that in making the character move more normally and nicely bend to do it job and then come back up and walk back before
										returning control to the player.  The scene I am describing is on the plane when the guy walks out to get the heart.  This was just one scene I improved on and did art for.  
										I learned about the point and to make sure they all lined up in the file for a smooth look.  It was great fun and a lot of learning.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>I performed art modifications for 4 levels.</li>  
											<li>I script programmed using engine programmers created language and level built 4 out of 6 levels.</li> 
											<li>I improved on existing design for all levels causing the praise from the man who wrote the book.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>As a result of my learning to modify art and my eye to detail, the author of the book this game was done on loved it and actually stated nice things about it.  This wasn't the author normal tone on anything.  So he was very impressed with my improvements to the game</p>

										<h3>Dinotopia</h3>
									  <p>I start in September 1995 on this project and ended on November 1995.  The engine for this game was to be the engine that was being created for Fair Tale Adventure II.  This game went to market before the engine was done.
									  This made it very interesting and puzzle solving for me.  I didn't have all the tools I needed to do the puzzles justice.  But even the lead programmer on Fair Tale Adventure II stated at a gathering that I did things so 
									  cleverly that I was able to get all the puzzles to work without the engine being completed.  I had to use several of the different tools together to get the desire effect which wasn't what the programmers wanted.</p>
									  <ul>
										  <li>I was lead level builder</li>
										  <li>I implemented/Scripted all puzzles, paths for special effects and events, reactions on object and events, sound effects and voices.</li>
										  <li>I tested and analyzed problem areas.</li> 
										  <li>I created and gave reports to programmers.</li>  
										  <li>I organized, managed, and trained level builders.</li>
									  </ul>
									  <p>I had one day to put all the voices scripting in and did it on time.  It was scheduled for over two weeks.</p>

							  <h3>Rhythm & Hues Studios</h3>
							  <p>I started working for this company a month after Dreamer Guild Inc bankruptcy in December 1996.  They were doing their first game and it showed.</p>
							  <p>I completed their two week training period within three days and started that afternoon working on actual levels.  I was told by the producer that since I was hired a month after everyone else I was only to have 9 levels.
							  That didn't last.  I ended up getting over 20 levels which I was able to turn around in two hours all changes on the list the producer left me from the day before.  My producer would come straight to the level building room before going 
							  to his and run through all my levels and then state continue doing what you are doing.</p>
							  <p>I always go beyond my job requirements to get the job done on time or beforehand.  I had created reports for producer on game play, improvements and general comments.  The first time I did this my producer ignored my list until the client came back with the same list.
							  Then whenever I gave a list he would have all of it implemented.</p>
							  <p>When I first was on the scene, I found out from the head of testing that the client wasn't able to play the game even though we could.  I thought that was odd and decided on my own time that the
							  next time a build was done I would do it and test all the CD going to the client.  I came in early that day by two hours.  Remember this was my own time and I couldn't use my normal time to do this.  The head of the testing department was on the first build when I came in.
							  He was tired and I told him as the first ended that if he shows me the steps I would complete all the builds.  He did and I asked how many goes to the client.  He stated five.  I told him I will completely test five CD's.</p>
							  <p>I finished the five just before my time to start working.  I also created a bug and improvement list for my producer on what I saw.  I continue to build more while I was doing my work.  Days later while working I heard the producer state to the engine programmer that the client was finally able to play
							  the game.  He thanked him for fixing the bug.  The programmer stated that he fixed anything.  The head of testing department was there and stated that I tested the five that went to the client and noone else touched it.  My producer was shocked.  All this time he thought it was a programming issue when it was simply a problem with the testers scratching the CDs.
							  I continued to do this for the rest of the game and the head of testing department wouldn't let anyone else touch the CD's I tested for the client.  The client never had anymore problems with the CD's sent.</p>

							  <h3>Prolific Publishing Inc</h3>
							  <p>I worked for this company from March 2000 to June 14, 2002 on three games.  I was the key to all the projects I worked on going to market.  Only when they laid me off did a project I worked on not go to market which was a pitty because it was a good idea.</p>
							  <p>On all below, I went beyond my responsibility in order to meet deadlines.  I organized, trained and managed other level builders.  I handled all script programming (language created by the engine programmers – had to figure out on my own in a short amount of time) while other level builders just placed objects in.
							  I debugged the engine programmer’s code to meet deadlines and improve game play.  I provide feedback on any bugs and on how to improve the game.  I debugged and analyzed game play.  The designer on the games wasn't up to par and I even had to design which I 
							  didn't mind since I designed the levels anyway.</p>

											<li>I level built half the game using 3D Max.</li>
											<li>I placed in all the sounds and triggers used in all levels of the game.</li>
											<li>I level designed over half of the game when the designer was blocked or too busy to do it and we needed to get it done for a milestone.</li>
											
										</ul>										
										<p>I came up with a new design for game when client was about to pull out during a meeting with the owner of the company.  They presented it that day to client and the 
										client approved it saving the game.  When I was laid off, the game was unable to be completed because noone knew how to script the game since I was the only one scripting everything.
										Other level builders didn't have the knowledge I had and were unable to finish.  The client as a result pulled out.</p>
