										<h3 class="major">Home</h3>
										<p>I have been a programmer since 1989.  First I started in Philadelphia as a programmer for Keystone Computer Associates.</p>
										<p>My free spirit caused me to pack up everything when my rental lease was up and move.  During my move I settled on Buena Park California due to a person I met on the move who knew of a room for rent.  Within a couple of months I had a job at Hughes Aircraft and started on the EPLRS project.  I worked in all phases of EPLRS project ending with field testing it.  After goverment contracts started drying up and I was laid off, I reeducated myself with windows programmer for creating games.  </p>
										<p>I proceeded to get into the gaming industry and started on my first game which was "I have no mouth and I must scream".  This was my starting point of creativity.  I was always interested in art and now I was able to dive into it.  </p>
										<p>So for the next seven years, I was in and out of gaming companies using my abilities from game design to testing.  I worked in all aspect of the industry and enjoyed every moment.</p>
										<p>My last gaming company going under or getting out of the industry caused me to realized that at that time the industry was slowing down.  So once more it was time for me to move and start an new adventure.</p>
										<p>Montana ended up being that move.  I needed to change my life and job while there.  I didn't stop trying to find a tech job but did do other work while looking.  I even worked as a gardner helper which she actually stated to me that she didn't think I would last past two weeks.  Months later still working for her, she stated that I was the only one that was able to plant the plants where she wanted them and correctly.  This was interesting since I only worked for her for a short time over people who have worked for her for years.

This was true at all the non tech jobs I was working before getting a web programming job at Bigfork Web Development.  I admit I was confused by this since the jobs were so easy that I couldn't understand the problem with doing it right.
</p>
										<p>My first two reviews by the owner were great ending with I would give you more of a salary increase if not for the economy.  Two weeks before I was to receive my week vacation at Bigfork Web Development, the owner did another review.
										After he hired two new people.  He didn't have enough money to pay for me and the two new hires.  Since he promised the new programmer that he would hire his fiance to get him to accept the position, someone had to go.</p>
										<p>My review was based on the programmer's fiancee work that he didn't like and the project manager who gave me wrong information on a project that I implemented.  My back end code as he stated was great.  But because of the other two errors, I was put on probation telling me I should have realized they made mistakes.
										This happened two weeks before my year anniversary.  So he didn't give me my week vacation.  I still remember his statement to me "I know you didn't create the template.  But should have noticed the problem and fixed it.  As to the information from the project manager, you should have known the client didn't want the actual name on the site.  So you are on probation and any more will end in your termination."  He also reduced my hours to under 10 a week.</p>
										<p>An interesting point, the fiancee was promoted to lead designer even though from his own statement he didn't like her work.  Also nothing happened to the project manager.  He also admitted I didn't know the name of the client so I couldn't know it wasn't to be on the website.  
										I knew what was going on and realized that the time I gave them doing my job correctly was over shadowed by him wanting to make the new programmer happy.  
										This way he didn't have to pay me if he laid me off or for the vacation time I almost earned.  It was a win win for him.  I am telling you this so you understand I wouldn't have left this company.  I was happy there and did my back end programming job correctly.
										I do understand why the owner did what he did and he did what he thought was right at that time.  I was logical for him and I have no feels one way or another about it.  So that is why I was only there about a year.  I couldn't live on 6 to 10 hours a week.</p>
										<p>Now I had it with working for others at that time.  Working with the physical jobs, ended in threaths of physical harm and mistreatments.  Working with tech, ended with me getting blamed for others mistake with the others getting promoted or no discipline.  So it was time for me to be a contractor. </p>
										<p>I started by working for Steve Pittenger which was a major mistake.  He would want things cheap and tell me that his client wants it down and dirty.  I would tell him that is sloppy coding.  But he would push that is what they want.  OK!  So I need the jobs and the client is always right.  I did what he stated on skype or phone.
										  He constantly told me he would send me email with what I was todo but he needed me to start immediately.  Major mistake!  He never sent me the email and kept stating to me when he wanted more coding that it was part of the deal.  I spent more then 200 hours doing rework because instead of down and dirty they wanted good coding which was what I pushed for in the first place.  But they didn't want to pay for that coding.</p>
										<p>This was a lesson learn for a new person in contracting.  Get everything in writing!  But since Steve Pittenger doesn't like emailing for the next project I had to be smart.  I got off skype and didn't answer my phone.  As a result, he had no other choice but to email me what he wanted.</p>
										<p>Smart this time!  I did down and dirty coding per his email for the next project.  But like before he would email me wanting more detailed programming.  This time I was able to send the email to him and state that I would be happy to do the code but it would cost since I did exactly what you request of me.</p>
										<p>He would email me back stating forget it.  Now, I am finally doing things right.  I may not like the fact that he only wants sloppy coding but I am only getting paid for sloppy coding and not what it would take to do it correctly.</p>
										<p>I didn't last long working with him.  I couldn't take the sloppy coding anymore and moved on.  I actually moved to Central Oregon where I tried to get into a company which I couldn't find one.  It seems that for every listing over 100 resumes were recieved.</p>
										<p>So I went back into contract and anything else I could find.  In the meantime, I continued to up my skills by making demo games and creating art for the games.</p>
